# ONS Data Challenge 2019 - Is loneliness associated with movement for education?

## To view the analysis 
The final report is available at 'ONS_Data_Challenge_Report.HTML'

# To re-run the analysis and results
Run the top-level file called 'source'. This will recreate all the RDS documents in the set-up-files, and the master df. 
Alternatively you can re-create the final dataset from the RDS objects already available by running the master_dataset.R file. 

All analyses are available in the 'modelling data.R' document, and the 'ONS Data Challenge Report.Rmd', which contains the markdown code for the final report.
