## To view the analysis 
The final report is available at 'ONS_Data_Challenge_Report.HTML'

## To re-run the analysis and results
Running the .R files in '/set-up-files' will recreate all the RDS files needed to run 'master_dataset.R'. The only dataset not given in this repo is the loneliness dataset, which is only available directly from the ONS. 

All analyses are available in the 'modelling data.R' document, and the 'ONS Data Challenge Report.Rmd', which contains the markdown code for the final report.
